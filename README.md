How to use the C++ code:
  Compile with: 'g++ frisbee.cpp'
  Then run './a.out'

  This reads in the starting conditions for the frisbee from param.dat, runs the flight simulation and then creates the data.dat file which can be graphed to show the trajectory.

  Use xmgrace to graph.

How to use the Ruby code:
  Run with 'ruby frisbee.rb'

  This reads in the starting conditions for the frisbee from param.dat, runs the flight simulation and then creates the data.rb.dat file which can be graphed to show the trajectory.

  Use xmgrace to graph.
